# Understanding Software Engineering and App Development

## Software Engineering

The software engineering role involves a lot more than just writing code and building features. Software engineering involves designing cost-efficient and performance adhering systems. The discipline requires a lot more knowledge involving Computer Science and the inner workings of a computer. A good description I can think of is a software developer who implements theories behind Computer Science.

- More stable
- More difficult
- Full-Stack/Backend developer

## Application Development

The application developer role involves a lot more feature implementaton through writing code. Generally, we associate application developers with people who do a lot of aesthetic and functionality design of an application instead of performance and cost-efficiency. This discipline requires a lot less theory and algorithmic excellence.

- More volatile
- More enjoyable
- Frontend/Full-Stack developer

## The Good
- High pay
- Fast-paced environment
- Flexible hours and location
- Lots of jobs

## The Bad
- Burn out - Have to learn to fight back and protect oneself
